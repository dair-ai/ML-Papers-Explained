| [Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling](https://ritvik19.medium.com/papers-explained-336-rethinking-compute-optimal-test-time-scaling-732ee1134883) | February 2025 | Investigates compute-optimal Test-Time Scaling (TTS) for Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the influence of policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty. Through experiments on MATH-500 and AIME24. |
| [CHallenging AI with Synthetic Evaluations (CHASE)](https://ritvik19.medium.com/papers-explained-340-chase-84857503f39c) | February 2025 | A framework for generating challenging LLM evaluation benchmarks synthetically, using a bottom-up approach, building complex problems from simpler components and hiding solution elements within the context, while decomposing the generation process into verifiable sub-tasks to ensure correctness. |
| [Large-Scale Data Selection for Instruction Tuning](https://ritvik19.medium.com/papers-explained-338-large-scale-data-selection-for-instruction-tuning-72ef9f8221aa) | March 2025 | Investigates the effectiveness and scalability of automated data selection methods for instruction-tuning LLMs, finding that many existing methods underperform random selection at larger scales. A variant of representation-based data selection (RDS+), using weighted mean pooling of pre-trained LM hidden states, consistently outperforms other methods, including in multi-task settings |
| [Transformers without Normalization](https://ritvik19.medium.com/papers-explained-335-transformers-without-normalization-a1cec27c2c4f) | March 2023 | Introduces Dynamic Tanh (DyT), a simple element-wise operation replacing normalization layers in Transformers, achieving comparable or better performance across various tasks in vision, language, and speech by emulating Layer Normalization's tanh-like activation mapping and scaling without statistical computation, challenging the perceived indispensability of normalization and potentially improving efficiency. |
| [SmolDocling](https://ritvik19.medium.com/papers-explained-333-smoldocling-a788ac739b92) | March 2025 | A compact 256M parameter vision-language model designed for end-to-end document conversion into a novel universal markup format called DocTags, which captures content, structure, and spatial location of all page elements. It leverages a curriculum learning approach trained on augmented existing and novel datasets for comprehensive document understanding, achieving performance comparable to much larger models while minimizing computational requirements. |
